Managed to finish the intro scene and it looks awesome! Also pretty sure I've finished the entire project!!!!

Might do some minor checks tomorrow or even add more minor stuff such as a skip button for the intro (so myself or others don't need to wait for it to finish everytime), but that honestly won't take long.

Overall pretty happy with this project and loved it all so far, probably going to have more of a reflection documentation entry tomorrow where I talk moments that have gone well, gone badly and what I would do differently or if it was a larger scale project.
