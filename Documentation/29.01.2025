Started adding some settings to the settings screen by having an object which updates everytime a setting is changed, making it easier to apply it to the rest of the code.

Was a small session today as I was busy and didn't really have much time, but still happy with the progress I've made.

Future development could be to fix double click issue by looking at old code that would change how settings work or by trying a new method I find with research.
