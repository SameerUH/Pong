All I have now is a base game but I do have a check list of stuff I want to hopefully add in the future

Checklist:
1. Score.
2. Start screen.
3. Settings screen.
4. Computer A.I.
5. Possibly an intro scene.

Hoping I can figure all of this out and I have added some of these features before on other games but an A.I. and an intro scene might honestly be the most difficult. I may also change the ball's movement mechanics from randomly going up and down to a more realistic mechanic when the player/enemy hits the ball.
