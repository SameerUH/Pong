Fixed an issue with the game screen not uploading as I forgot to add "pygame.display.update()" to it's function.

Started on a settings and pause screen which went okay. Managed to make a pause screen and get it to work, still need to work on the design of it though.

Figured out that pygame sometimes take 2 inputs instead of one so decided to instantly move a button whenever I click on it to avoid double inputs.

Other than that it went well today and will probably finish the design of the pause screen and start doing settings stuff next commit.
